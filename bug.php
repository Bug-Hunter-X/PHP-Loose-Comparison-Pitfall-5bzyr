This code suffers from a subtle issue related to how PHP handles type juggling and comparison.  The `if` condition `$a == $b` uses loose comparison, which can lead to unexpected results when comparing different data types. In this case, when `$a` is a string '1' and `$b` is an integer 1, the loose comparison considers them equal. However, if we use strict comparison `$a === $b`, the condition would be false, because the types differ.
